# SubnetMaster

Overview:
This Subnetting Tool is a versatile Python-based application designed to assist network administrators, IT professionals, and networking students in planning and organizing network subnetting. It automates the process of subnet calculation, providing essential information for each subnet, including the subnet IP, IP range, and subnet mask.

Features to be Implemented:

Dynamic Subnet Calculation: Calculates subnet masks and IP ranges based on the number of required hosts per subnet.

User-Friendly Input: Allows users to input the name and host count for each subnet, facilitating easy identification and organization.

Subnet Utilization Metrics: Provides metrics on the utilization of each subnet, aiding in efficient IP address management.

Graphical Representation: Offers a visual representation of the network topology, enhancing understanding and planning.

Overlap Detection: Ensures that defined subnets do not overlap, preventing configuration errors.

Subnet Aggregation: Suggests optimal aggregation of subnets for simplified routing and network management.

Automated Network Diagrams: Generates network diagrams based on subnetting information for documentation and presentation purposes.


Usage:
Ideal for small to medium-sized organizations, educational purposes, or individual network projects, this tool simplifies and streamlines the process of subnetting. Whether you're designing a new network or reconfiguring an existing one, this tool provides a user-friendly and efficient way to handle subnetting tasks.
